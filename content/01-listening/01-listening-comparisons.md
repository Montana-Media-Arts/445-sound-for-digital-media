# Comparing/Testing Speakers and/or Headphones

We know that our listening devices (i.e. speakers or headphones) are critical in our ability to make decisions about our work or audio-related works. The question then becomes how do you evaluate speakers or headphones for the value and acceptability? One important task is to develop a list of tracks that you know and trust. These should demonstrate multiple qualities for a listening environment. Below are some suggestions;

## Pristine

So, let’s start with the easy stuff – pristine, well recorded tracks.  Simply put - if this doesn’t sound good, nothing will.  These tracks have been recorded to such a high standard that, excuse the blasphemy, playing them through some Apple Ear pods would verge on acceptable, so pass it through some decent Hi-Fi and they’ll knock your socks off.

- Steely Dan - Babylon Sisters
- Steely Dan – Jack Of Speed
- Daft Punk – Get Lucky


## Dynamic

Up next, tracks with wide dynamic range and excellent sound stages. Listen out for spatial separation between individual instruments and vocals and feeling like your living room just turned into the Royal Albert Hall and you’re on the right track.

- Stevie Ray Vaughan – Tin Pan Alley
- The Rolling Stones - Melody
- English Chamber Orchestra - Dido & Aeneas, Act 3: But Death, Alas!
- Deutsche Grammophon - Mahler Symphony no. 2 - Chicago, Claudio Abbado - 5th Mvt.
- Deutsche Grammophon - Mahler Symphony no. 2 - New York, Bernstein - 4th Mvt.
- Deutsche Grammophon - Mahler Symphony no. 2 - New York, Bernstein - 5th Mvt.


## Foot Tab-Ability

A hugely important but often less observed category: Foot-tap-ability. Ever listened to one of your favorite ever tracks on a speaker but your foot remains mysteriously unmoved by it? If these tunes don’t make you twitch, run in the opposite direction. They’re just not going to keep up.

- Lou Reed – Walk on the Wild Side
- Dave Matthews Band - Where are you going


## Bass

The Big One – Bass. Irritating if there’s too much, crushingly disappointing if there’s too little.  Definitely the category that turns us all into the Goldilocks of the audio testing world. The following will test your subs on long droney background bass and fast punchy bass.

- Beck – Morning
- The Weeknd – The Hills
- Bela Fleck – Flight of the Cosmic Hippo
- Thundercat - Uh Uh
- Paradise Circus - Massive Attack
- How Low - Ludacris


## Complexity and Balance

And lastly, our favorite category, the ‘if you can listen to these tracks all the way through without switching them off you’re on to a winner’ test.  These songs pack a lot in to each track and without capable audio equipment can sound, quite frankly, a mess. So when you get them right, that’s a whole heap of audio satisfaction (and a few smug engineers).


- Time - Hans Zimmer
- Alabama Shakes – Don’t Wanna Fight
- Radiohead - The National Anthem
- AC/DC – It’s a Long Way to the Top (WARNING! Contains Bagpipes, proceed with caution)
- Pink Floyd - Money
- Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody
