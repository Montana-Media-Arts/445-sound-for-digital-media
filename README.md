## COURSE OVERVIEW

_Sound for Digital Media_ is an advanced, project based course focusing on the technical and aesthetic qualities of creating sound, sonic art, and music for and with digital media. This course will aim to teach students technical skills, including; digital signal theory, signal flow, advanced microphone techniques, session management and workflow, assisted sound synthesis, advanced mixing, and mastering. Artistically and creatively, this course will study artists involved in electronic music, sound for the web, sonic artists, audio engineers, and commercial sound. The study of these artists will offer an aesthetic grounding for students to work against as they create their own audio based art, or work to capture the sonic art of other artists.

This course can more simply be thought of as an advanced sound studio course. There will be a lot of hands-on learning, work with studio resources, and work with professional studio software.
