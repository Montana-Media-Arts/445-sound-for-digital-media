# Project 1 - Get to know your fellow classmates (or my Ableton Crash Intro Project)

In an effort to shake off the cob webs and allow everyone an opportunity to get to know each others artistic/musical personalities, we will open the semester with an open format project.

## Style and Technical Specifics

You are welcome to create whatever you want stylistically.

However, I would like you to include the following technical Specifics:

1. That resulting work should be 00:20 to 03:00 in length.
2. Please submit both a 2-track master, as well as the "save and collect"-ed Ableton session.
3. You should have at least 1 sound that you record yourself.
4. There should be at least 1 sample that you bring in and manipulate heavily. (This could be the sound you record or not)
5. There should be at least 1 synthesized sound.
6. There should be at least 1 real-time effect.
7. There should be automation beyond volume.

## More Information

For those of you who are coming back to Ableton, this serves as a project to shake the cob webs off. For those of you new to Ableton, this is your chance to get caught up with this tool.
