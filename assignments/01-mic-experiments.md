# Assignment 1 | Microphone Experiments in The Field

Take out a handheld hard disk recorder or USB-based audio interface.

## Goals

1. Become familiar with the audio recording chain.
    - Setup your device to capture at a minimum of
        - 44.1kHz sample rate
        - 24 bit depth


## Equipment to Check Out

- Omni-directional studio microphone
    - AT 2050
    - Shure KSM141
    - AKG C414
- A mic stand
- an XLR cable
- A recording device
    - A zoom H4N
    - or focusrite 2i2 interface

## Exercises

1. Soundscape recording
    - Setup your system somewhere sonically "interesting".
    - Make a 2 minute recording using a single omni-directional microphone.
    - At the same time that you make this recording, I want you to actively listen to the same soundscape, and subsequently write down in high-detail a description of this soundscape.
    - I then want you to either listen back over headphones or decent speakers to your recording and compare your notes to what you hear from the "microphone".
    - Do this twice in different locations.
2. Find a sound source that is repeatable (meaning you can capture it at least 3 times).
    - Record at least 10 versions.
    - the first 6, should be 3 close positions.
        - You will record at each position twice, in both omni and cardioid polar pattern modes.
        - Then record twice more in omni and cardioid, respectively, at a medium distance.
        - Repeat at a far distance.

## Deliverables

- We will discuss in class your findings as groups. Please be prepared to playback examples where relevant.
- Additionally, each student should submit a short technical write-up described their perceived differences between positions and modes. Please also describe the differences in your free-field hearing verse captured audio of the soundscape piece.
