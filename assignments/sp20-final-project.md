# Final Sonic Art Project

**Due: Week 15 - April 28th, 2020**

## Specification

Create, compose, devise, develop, or record a sonic art work of your own desire. This work can be any format and take any nature, as long as sound is the primary focus of the work.

Examples:

- A live performance work
- A fixed studio-style work
- A headphone-based soundscape or soundwalk
- A sonic sculpture
- A sound-based installation
- A spoken-word piece with accompanying sound design
- A radio-play

There is no time minimum of maximum. However, if your work is quite long or of an indefinite length, then an excerpt will be used for critique purposes.

This would should push you artistically and technically.


## Deliverables

Regardless of the format of your work, it needs to be documented and presentable for the class critique in some sort of fixed-media fashion. This means that you need to deliver a media file (.wav, .aiff, .mp4) representing your work.

If there is any accompanying materials, scores, code, or instructions, these should be compiled in a PDF document and also submitted.
