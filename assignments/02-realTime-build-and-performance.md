# Assignment 2 | Real-Time Build and Performance

To become comfortable working in Ableton Live in Real-Time.

**DUE: Monday, October 29th. In class.**

## Ideas:

This could be a work about anything you want, but here are some ideas of directions to head or topics to consider.

- Are you doing something that is "music" or sonic art?
- Will it be harmonically oriented?
- What is a real-time soundscape exploration like in this setting?
- Why do we need technology to mediate or facilitate the creation of sonic art?
- What am I learning in this course?
- How do I listen to the world? How does this differ from other people? Do we all listen the same?
- What does it mean to alter/change a recording of something/someone?


## Specification

- Working in groups of 2-3, develop a sonic artwork in Ableton Live that can be presented in real-time.
- Since you may or may not be able to save/export, you may need to develop a work that you can quickly rebuild with notes.
- You are also welcome to utilize the Media Arts Sound Studio to develop this work so that you can save a version to load in the classroom for presentation.
- You are welcome to build this sonic artwork in the "Session View" (i.e. using clips) or the "Arrangement View" (i.e. fixing time relationships and automation).

## Techniques You MUST UTILIZE

The following techniques should be utilized.

- Create a bank of pre-recorded media that you load into your session.
- You should utilize at least one synthesized track (i.e. use one "instrument" and do something with it).
- Change in amplitude and parameter values.
    - You should plan to change amplitude of individual tracks or send volumes. This can be done either through automation or direct manipulation of track amplitudes.
    - You should also change at least one parameter other than amplitude (i.e. an effect parameter).

## Techniques to Consider Incorporating

The following techniques are optional. However, you should incorporate at least one of these into your work.

- Custom recorded content.
    - Go capture custom content using a zoom or your computer and a decent microphone from the media arts equipment checkout.
    - Use this content to create your work in whole or partially.
- Mapping with ASCII-keyboard or MIDI Gear.
    - Map parameters from your ASCII keyboard or a MIDI device to elements in your session.
    - You may need to checkout a MIDI device from the equipment checkout room (we only one) or Dr. Musick.
- Live input processing.
    - Use an interface and decent microphone to get audio data into your session to process and manipulate live.
    - You may need to checkout an interface and microphone.

## Presentation

We will present these at the start of class.

- If you need multiple computers, please let me know, and I will route them all through the main room monitors.
- Otherwise, you are welcome to present the work from any computer in the room or the main teaching station.
