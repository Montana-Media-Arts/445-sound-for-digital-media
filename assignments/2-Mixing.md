# Project 2</br>Multi-Track Mixing

- **Due (In-Class Critique):** Thursday, February 27th.

We have spent a couple weeks discussing mixing techniques and strategies. The goal of this work has been to isolate the process of mixing sound/audio/music from the creative process of creation, recording, and synthesizing. Admittedly, this examination has been primarily through the lens of mixing music for popular distribution. However, the same concepts, techniques, and skills will apply towards the process of mixing audio for other purposes.

In order to practice these skills, I want you to mix a song, that is not an original creation by yourself. Thereby, you will put yourself in the position of working as the mix engineer, who is divorced from the ego of being the original artist/composer/producer.

# Getting Started

To get started, I want you to identify and download an unmixed session. This can be from any source, but you should likely grab something from the "Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio" website.

I would suggest you pick a track that is stylistically something you enjoy listening to, and that is not _too big_ with respect to track count. Any session with between 8-16 tracks is likely sufficient for your first mix project.

> If you want to mix something you have played on, or that is of your own music, you may under a few conditions.
>
> 1. Talk with me first to get explicit permission.
> 2. You should not have been the one to record or compose the track. Instead, this path is only appropriate if you simply played on the track.

# The Actual Assignment

Following the suggestions and workflow discussed in class, along with the processes presented in Mike Senior's _Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio_, you are expected to create a final mixdown of your chosen track.

At a high level, this will include;

1. Setting up a session, organizationally, and structurally
2. Identifying and selecting mix references into a playlist.
3. Listening for what is there and may be missing
4. Adjusting any timing or tuning adjustments
5. Build a raw mix (start at the end or most important section)
6. Applying compression and EQ to create space and smoothness to the mix
7. Adding reverb, delays, and stereo enhancements to sweeten the mix.
8. Add master bus compression and/or EQ
9. Add automation to smooth out sections
10. Add detailed fader motions
11. Listening on lots of systems
12. Identify remaining problems and fix
13. Print the mix

# Deliverables

Your final mix will be played back in-front of the class from the session file. If this is not possible, you are instead requested to take lots of screen shots to discuss your process while we audition the final 2-track mix.
