# COURSE OVERVIEW

## Basic Info

- Name: Sound for Digital Media
- Course Number: MART 445
- CRN: 33391
- Credits: 3
- Location: McGill 127 & Sound Studio - McGill 123
- Date/Time: TR, 11:00AM-12:20PM


## Description

_Sound for Digital Media_ is an advanced, project based course focusing on the technical and aesthetic qualities of creating sound, sonic art, and music for and with digital media. This course will aim to teach students technical skills, including; digital signal theory, signal flow, advanced microphone techniques, session management and workflow, assisted sound synthesis, advanced mixing, and mastering. Artistically and creatively, this course will study artists involved in electronic music, sound for the web, sonic artists, audio engineers, and commercial sound. The study of these artists will offer an aesthetic grounding for students to work against as they create their own audio based art, or work to capture the sonic art of other artists.

This course can more simply be thought of as an advanced sound studio course. There will be a lot of hands-on learning, work with studio resources, and work with professional studio software.

## Objectives and Student Learning Outcomes (SLO's)

Through this advanced course, students are expected to:

- Integrate skills from all sonic arts courses towards the creation of portfolio quality creative works.
- Present one larger work to the public.
- Compare and analyze canonical works against each other as well as individually created personal art works or audio recordings.
- Through an iterative process, students are expected to asses the success and failing of individual aesthetic choices within their own artwork with the goal of revising artworks.
- Demonstrate high technical proficiency of synthesis, recording, digital signal processing, and mixing with respect to both technical and creative applications.
- Employ mastering techniques to prepare works for distribution via appropriate media and avenues.
- Explore their creative process through sonic-based art works or compositions


Students are expected to bring ideas to explore these techniques. The goals of the projects are not simply about the successful application of the technical processes. Instead, the goal is to integrate these technical elements to make work that is meaningful.

## Pre-Requisites

For this semester, there are no specific pre-req's for this course. Instead, you are expected to utilize your previous expertise in sound, audio, music, and film towards the projects presented in the course.

With that being said, it is suggested that you have taken Intro to Sonic Art (MART 245), Principles of Sound (MART 330), as well as Sound for Film (MART 345).

## Books and Supplies

There are no required texts that you must purchase for this course. All readings, music, or sound examples will be available to you through web links, the library, or the class Moodle.

### Headphones

You will need to bring a pair of headphones for work in this class. I would suggest you invest in a good pair, as part of your grade will be based on the technical quality of your work. If you cannot hear issues because you have poor quality headphones, then you are risking poor grades.

You are looking for reference quality headphones. That means headphones that present your audio to you as honest and neutral as possible. A bad mix should sound like a bad mix. Hyped headphones that accentuate bass or high frequencies in flattering ways can hide detail and mix issues.

For more info, the following guide provides good information on the two major types of headphones and suggestions.

- [Best Studio Headphones: The Ultimate Musician’s Guide](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com/best-recording-studio-headphones/)


### Computer

You will need access to a computer capable of running modern audio synthesis and signal processing environments, as well as digital audio workstations (DAWs) and editing software. This computer should also be capable of real-time signal processing through analog inputs and outputs (i.e., using an audio interface or web cam). Please leverage departmental resources whenever necessary.

### Software

For this semester, instruction of technology specific skills will be demonstrated and taught in [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/shop/education/). This is an industry standard for creative applications with audio and sound. This is also a piece of software that will be taught in courses throughout the sonic arts track.

You are encouraged to purchase this software or utilize media art's computer labs, where it is available for student use.



# Policies

## Course Evaluation

Student work and progress will be assessed through:


- Weekly Sketches
    - You will be assigned weekly sketches/compositions/exercises to practice the techniques being discussed in class.
    - These are critical to your development.
- Projects
	- There will be two assigned projects throughout the semester that relate to the current topics being discussed.
- Project Presentation
    - At least one, but more likely two, of the projects from this semester are required to be presented publicly. These will likely occur through course organized shows.
- Project Documentation
	- Each project will require project documentation, including; a demo video, written technical report, and written description.
- In-class discussions and critiques
    - You are expected to engage with class discussions about technical and artistic issues.
    - You are expected to engage with class discussions about outside readings, videos, and listenings.
    - You are expected to engage in class critique days of all projects.


#### Projects

We will have projects throughout the course that are relevant to concepts, techniques, and creative ideas from recent content.

Project grades will be based primarily on the student’s ability to:

1.  Demonstrate an understanding of the specific characteristics and integrative capabilities of the assigned topic through artistic output, written documentation, and technical achievement.
2.  Articulate a clear and concise perspective.
3.  Present an organized artistic piece, as well as; technical report, file/program structure, and demo video.
4.  Demonstrate creativity beyond the expected technical requirements.
5.  Properly and punctually deliver all assignment files.

**Please Note:** All Projects are required for this course. Failure to complete and submit a project will result in a failing grade for the course. There are no exceptions to this rule. Completion of this course requires all projects be completed.

#### Participation

This class will be participatory, and you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students.



## Grades

#### Final Grades

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

- In-class discussions and critiques: 10%
- Projects: 80%
- Final Project Presentation: 10%


Letters are assigned according to the following final course percentages:

| Grade | % Range 	|
|:-----:|:---------:|
| A  	| 93-100	|
| A- 	| 90-93		|
| B+ 	| 87-90		|
| B  	| 83-87		|
| B- 	| 80-83		|
| C+ 	| 77-80		|
| C  	| 73-77		|
| C- 	| 70-73		|
| D  	| 60-70		|
| F  	| 0-59		|


#### Late Work

IMPORTANT: Since projects are experienced as a group in class or through a public presentation, late projects are not permissible and will not be accepted.

Documentation assignments or weekly sketches handed in after the due date and time will have points deducted for lateness. This will be in addition to any points deducted for content. Those that are uploaded late but within one day of the due date will lose 5% for lateness.  For those uploaded after that, the number of deducted points will be at the discretion of the professor.

## Attendance

- Attendance will be taken at the beginning of every class
- Critique days are mandatory. No exceptions. No tardiness.
- Contact me in advance if you will not be in class. (email is preferred)
- Unexcused absences will affect your grade.
- One absence is allowed; after that, your final overall grade for the course will drop by 2.5 pts out of 100 for each additional absence.
- You are expected to work with colleagues to catch-up on what you missed.


## Plagiarism and Cheating Policy

Students are expected to adhere to academic conduct policies of the University of Montana as explained in Section V of your [University of Montana Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/vpesa/Dean%20of%20Students/default.php):  “Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or a disciplinary sanction by the University.  Academic misconduct is defined as all forms of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to:  (1) plagiarism, (2) misconduct during an examination or academic exercise, (3) unauthorized possession of examination or other course materials, (4) tampering with course materials, (5) submitting false information, (6) submitting work previously presented in another course, (7) improperly influencing conduct, (8) substituting, or arranging substitution, for another student during an examination or other academic exercise, (9) facilitating academic dishonesty, and (10) Altering transcripts, grades, examinations, or other academically related documents.”

Dishonesty will not be tolerated in this course. This includes, but is not limited to, cheating on tests, cheating on assignments, fabricating information or citations, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used, or tampering with the academic work of other students.

Plagiarism is the presentation of the work of another without acknowledgement. As defined by the [University of Montana’s Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/vpsa/policies/default.php), plagiarism is “Representing another person's words, ideas, data, or materials as one's own.”  Students may use information and ideas expressed by others, but this use must be identified by appropriate referencing.

Students who cheat or plagiarize will receive academic sanctions, which may include an “F” grade on the assignment, examination, and/or in the course. Students will also be reported to the Dean of Students for possible further disciplinary action.

#### Using Code or Media Found Elsewhere

It is easy to find code and media (i.e. videos, sounds, images, etc.) online. If you use code or media from elsewhere (which you will at times), I expect you to cite the work and author.

If you use found code, you are expected to comment each line, as to what each line does programmatically. _Do not_ summarize several lines of code from a high level (i.e., TV Guide). I expect you to comment each line on a granular level. In addition, in these cases, I am also looking for significant modification of the code, for you to enact your own ideas and to experiment heavily. Significant modification means beyond variable name and value changes. It is bending these concepts to your idea, especially graphically. It is not a copy and paste job. Also, never more than 40% of your code may be supplied from elsewhere. Period. If you use code from online, whether for inspiration, modification or reference, I expect to see a link in your comments from where you got the code and who wrote it. Otherwise it will be considered as plagiarism, and you will fail the assignment. The code must have a reference, along with URL and be commented out LINE BY LINE.

If you use found media, *YOU* are responsible to ensure it is used according to fair-use guidelines. The pieces you make in this course are intended to be portfolio-quality works. Therefore, you should not utilize found media with restrictive use guidelines or licenses. You can read more about various licenses at;

- [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/legal/)
- [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com)

- [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/)
- [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/licenses)

For found media, you are also expected to cite the media in your documentation for the project.



## Students with Disabilities

The University of Montana assures equal access to instruction through collaboration between students with disabilities, instructors, and Disability Services for Students. Students with disabilities are encouraged to plan ahead and can contact [Disability Services for Students (DSS)](http://www.umt.edu/dss/). If you think you may have a disability adversely affecting your academic performance, and you have not already registered with Disability Services, please contact Disability Services in Lommasson Center 154, or call (406)243-2243. I will work with you and Disability Services to provide an appropriate modification.




## Changes to the Course

I reserve the right to change the intended content of this course throughout the semester. This may be done to adjust for the speed of the class, to better meet educational goals, or to account for changes in technology.
